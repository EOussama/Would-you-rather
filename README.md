## Description
This is a very, very simplistic desktop application, imitating the famous successful social game called [Either](http://either.io/), build in **C#**, and relying on **SQL Server** to managing and storing data.

### Note
> Before executing the application, make sure you set up a database via executing the queries inside of the _db_wyr.sql_ file
